# LocalPen  

## What the heck is this?  
LocalPen is a simple app for developing [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) pens in a local environment, configured with:  
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- JS(Babel)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- [FontAwesome Free](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free)
- freeCodeCamp Test Suite (un-comment in `webpack.config.js` to use)

## What's the point? Why not just use CodePen?  
Yeah, yeah, I know. I asked myself that many times after going down the [Webpack rabbit-hole](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/) to make this work. But, here's the thing - I was working through [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) projects to be hosted on CodePen, and I wanted to be able to use git as I worked and push to GitHub. So, this will let you do just that, and you can use your IDE/editor of choice and even work offline (with a few workarounds) if necessary. What's more - you get the benefit of Webpack's development server with hot-module-replacement (HMR); AND, if you happen to be working through freeCodeCamp's curriculum, you can activate the test suite by un-commenting its object in the `context.body.scripts` array of the `MiniHtmlWebpackPlugin` instance in `webpack.config.js`.

As configured, this runs in development mode and produces no production bundles. Of course, Webpack is capable of *so much more* than this; but, I had one goal and for that it worked well. If you'd like to extend/improve it with your own ideas, by all means, fork and go nuts with it! :)   

## Ok, how does this work?  
Right. So... I configured this to use Pug, PostCSS and JS(Babel) as they would appear in the three code panes of a CodePen pen with that setup. The corresponding files here are `src/index.pug`, `src/style.css`, and `src/script.js`, respectively. You'll still have to copy-paste the contents of those into CodePen if you want to host your work there; but, you can copy the contents of each, as-is. No trimming of `html`, `head` and `body` tags, because they don't exist in `src/index.pug` - those are inserted automatically by a plugin in `webpack.config.js` - so that it works similar to CodePen. 

Now, the `src/index.js` file is the [Webpack entry point](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/) that imports `src/index.pug`, `src/style.css`, and `src/script.js` into Webpack when it runs. In addition to that, it contains the function that enables Pug to work with HMR using [morphdom](https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom) to diff the HTML string generated by Pug with the existing DOM. 

If you're interested in tweaking this to your liking, you can see the [technical documentation](https://codepen.io/brimarq/full/gNaxGR) on how this was built (I actually used this for that project), which includes links to the packages I used and covers how to add external resources in the webpack config, if you wish.
